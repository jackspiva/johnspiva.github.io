        <p>My name is John (Jack) Connell Spiva. I was born in Nashville, TN on September 13, 1994.
        I went to University School of Nashville and graduated in 2013. I now currently attend Tufts
        University and am planning on graduating in May, 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>My biggest hobby is Ultimate Frisbee. I play on the team here at Tufts, the Tufts Elephant
        Men. I tore my ACL and meniscus in January of this year, but will hopefully return to play
        by October.</p>
